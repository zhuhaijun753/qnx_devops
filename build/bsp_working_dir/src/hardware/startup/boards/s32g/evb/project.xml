    <short>Startup for NXP S32G275 EVB board</short>
    <abstract><![CDATA[
	                The sstartup-s32g-evb program is responsible for the second stage initialization of the NXP S32G275 EVB Board. This stage mainly involves populating the syspage, which is an in-memory data structure that contains information about the system, such as memory size and location, information about the CPU(s), caches, clocks and timers, and interrupt subsystem. At runtime, the information in the syspage is accessed and used by procnto, and by various processes.
