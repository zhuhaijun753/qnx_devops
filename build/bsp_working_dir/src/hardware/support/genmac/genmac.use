%C [-m] [-p]
Generate a random MAC address based on the SOC's unique ID number and output on stdout

Options
none -> print ID number
"-m" -> print MAC address. For example a network driver parameter could be added when running io-pkt:
        mac=`genmac-mx6x -m`
"-p" -> Toggle the lower bit of the generated MAC address so that genmac can be run for 2 interfaces on the same target.
        Example: For 1st interface: mac=`genmac -m`
                 For 2nd interface: mac=`genmac -m -p`
